# Project Plan

This document outlines the phased approach for developing and maintaining the JavaScript Math Bounds project. Each phase includes actionable items with solution options.

## Phase 1: Initial Setup
- [ ] Organize code into logical directories (src, tests, docs, etc.)
  - Solution: Use standard folder structure for modularity
- [ ] Refactor code to ES6+ standards
  - Solution: Use modern JavaScript syntax and modules
- [ ] Add boilerplate configuration files (.gitignore, .editorconfig, etc.)
  - Solution: Adopt community best practices
- [ ] Set up basic documentation
  - Solution: Create README.md and docs folder
- [ ] Establish version control
  - Solution: Use Git and GitHub

## Phase 2: Core Functionality
- [ ] Implement geographic math utilities (degree/radian conversion, distance, bounding box)
  - Solution: Modularize functions in src/
- [ ] Add unit tests for all core functions
  - Solution: Use Jest or Mocha for testing
- [ ] Document API usage and examples
  - Solution: Expand README and docs
- [ ] Ensure code readability and maintainability
  - Solution: Add comments and docstrings
- [ ] Remove deprecated or unused code
  - Solution: Code review and cleanup

## Phase 3: Automation & CI/CD
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for build, test, and deploy
  - Solution: Add workflows in .github/workflows/
- [ ] Automate code formatting and linting
  - Solution: Integrate Prettier and ESLint
- [ ] Add scripts for common tasks (build, test, deploy)
  - Solution: Use scripts/ folder
- [ ] Monitor dependency updates
  - Solution: Use Dependabot or npm audit
- [ ] Document workflow in WORKFLOW.md
  - Solution: Step-by-step instructions

## Phase 4: Community & Contribution
- [ ] Create CONTRIBUTING.md and SECURITY.md
  - Solution: Guidelines for contributors and vulnerability reporting
- [ ] Add issue and pull request templates
  - Solution: Templates in .github/
- [ ] Define code ownership (CODEOWNERS)
  - Solution: Assign maintainers
- [ ] Encourage community feedback
  - Solution: Use Discussions and Issues
- [ ] Document contribution process
  - Solution: Update README and docs

## Phase 5: Long-Term Goals
- [ ] Expand geographic utilities (e.g., polygon bounds, area calculations)
  - Solution: Add new modules in src/
- [ ] Improve test coverage and CI reliability
  - Solution: Regular test audits
- [ ] Enhance documentation and examples
  - Solution: Add tutorials and guides
- [ ] Support additional mapping libraries
  - Solution: Abstract integration layer
- [ ] Foster open-source collaboration
  - Solution: Outreach and community events

**Project Purpose:**
JavaScript Math Bounds provides modular utilities for geographic calculations, including degree/radian conversion, distance computation, and bounding box logic. It is intended for developers working with mapping, GIS, or location-based applications.
